# KeraVision ‚Äì AI-Powered Keratoplasty Patient Monitoring Agent
# üìå Overview

KeraVision is an AI-powered, Telegram-integrated assistant designed to monitor keratoplasty (corneal transplant) patients post-surgery. It ensures timely symptom reporting, intelligent follow-ups, and empathetic patient engagement. The agent is optimized for both patients and clinicians, providing real-time insights and tracking recovery progress while reducing the risk of complications.

This project blends AI, conversational empathy, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver a supportive and clinically valuable recovery assistant.

# ‚ú® Key Features

* Post-Surgery Symptom Monitoring

  * Patients can report symptoms in natural language.

  * AI interprets severity levels and flags urgent cases.

* RAG-Powered Medical Guidance

  * Retrieves answers from official keratoplasty FAQs and guidelines.

  * Cites relevant sources (question numbers or document sections).

* Empathetic Conversation Design

  * AI communicates with warmth and reassurance.

  * Avoids off-topic or irrelevant advice.

* Follow-Up Scheduling

  * Automated reminders for check-ins, medication, and follow-up appointments.

  * Tracks both completed and pending tasks.

* Clinician Dashboard Ready (Optional)

  * Supports structured data output for medical record integration.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* Language Model: OpenAI GPT (with prompt engineering for empathy + precision)

* Frameworks: Python, LangChain

* Knowledge Retrieval: FAISS / Vector DB for storing keratoplasty documents

* Messaging Interface: Telegram Bot API

* Data Sources:
